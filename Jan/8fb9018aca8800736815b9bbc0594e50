Durban - A Durban resident has praised two members of private security company PT Alarms for their kindness for stopping to assist her on the N2 south-bound after a tyre blow-out on Sunday morning. The Durban resident, in a Facebook post, said that while driving to a family funeral on Sunday morning, she ended up with a tyre blow-out.  “This meant us pulling over on the side of the busy N2 South (just before the uMlazi off-ramp).” The resident added that two members from PT Alarms, who were identified as Dhevan Govindasamy and Levi Maistry by the company, had been travelling in the opposite direction but they stopped to assist her.  “Out of sheer humanity and kindness, they assisted us in changing the tyre and saved our lives in many ways. While the big name roadside assistance (names not mentioned) were transactional and proved unhelpful in the end, (the members) from PT Alarms assisted with patience and ease,” she posted. The resident said that she wanted to thank the two men for not only helping to change the tyre, but for “reminding us of the humanity that still exists in our community”. She said the men are “true assets to PT Alarms.” PT Alarms responded to the post by welcoming the gratitude of the Durban resident and congratulating the two members on their work.  “Committed to caring for and protecting our community. Great work Dhevan and Levi.” THE MERCURY
