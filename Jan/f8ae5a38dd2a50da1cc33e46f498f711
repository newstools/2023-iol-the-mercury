Durban - The heavy rains experienced over the past few weeks has caused large sinkholes to develop along one of the busiest roads in Pietermaritzburg. The city, together with the department of Transport closed off one lane of the Selby Msimang Road, near Edendale,  a few days ago after the sinkholes were discovered. Selby Msimang Road connects commuters from Edendale, Henley Dam and the upper Vulindlela area to the Pietermaritzburg central business district. Msunduzi deputy mayor Mxolisi Mkhize, accompanied by a team from the Department of Transport, assessed the road after the rain. In a statement, the Msunduzi Municipality said, the Department of Transport had closed off a section of the road to ensure the safety of commuters, especially those travelling from the upper area to the city. Work will begin to fix the road once the heavy rainfall subsides, it said. In a video, Mkhize said: “It has been discovered that on this road, there are two big sinkholes underneath one lane, we would like to warn communities that the road will be closed to protect the road users and we would like to apologise for the inconvenience to drivers. “Once the weather clears, the department will begin the process to repair this road,” he said.
