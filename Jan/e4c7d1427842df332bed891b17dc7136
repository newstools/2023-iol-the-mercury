Durban – Two men who allegedly robbed a tavern at gunpoint near Pinetown will go on trial at the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court in February. One of the accused, Sanele Ngema, 18, at one stage, was in a relationship with the tavern owner Thandiwe Ngcongo.  Ngema and Kwanele Nyathikazi, 20, made a brief appearance in court on Friday, charged with business robbery. Ngema was in Grade 11 at Dassenhoek High School when he appeared in court.  In his bid for bail he told the court that his girlfriend was four months pregnant and that he needed to attend school.  The pair allegedly robbed Ngcongo of R11 800, her cellphone, 12 vodka bottles, 48 ciders, and two boxes of beer each containing 12 beers inside. Nyathikazi in his bail bid told the court that he dropped out of school after Grade 11 when his mother died; he was unemployed, in search of a job and could afford R1 000. He was denied bail. Through an affidavit submitted in court, the investigating officer Sergeant Zakhele Msomi said that Nyathikazi had been called to the tavern by Ngcongo who is Ngema’s ex. The duo was playing a game of pool at the establishment when they decided to allegedly rob the tavern. Daily News
