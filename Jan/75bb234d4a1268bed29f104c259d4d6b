Durban — The National Freedom Party (NFP) has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to stop being an attention seeker every time the energy crisis becomes a thorny issue. This comes after Ramaphosa cancelled his trip to the World Economic Forum summit held in Davos, Switzerland, this week, while the country has been experiencing stage 6 load shedding.  The forum is an annual meeting of world leaders, business and civil society where Ramaphosa was meant to promote South Africa as an investment destination. In recent times Ramaphosa has cancelled and cut his trips short before to address the energy crises. The NFP secretary-general Canaan Mdletshe said Ramaphosa’s cancellation was nothing but a public relations exercise. Mdletshe said Ramaphosa should prioritise the people of this country by staying home and dealing with the electricity crisis.  Mdletshe added that it was tiring and irritating for the president to “pretend” to be someone who cares or is bothered by the current crisis. He claimed that the president is “as clueless as ourselves on the energy issue”.  “He does not know what to do. Clearly, we are on our own because we have a state president who is just hopeless on the matter,” he said. Moreover he said Ramaphosa must address the nation soon on the way forward and provide answers and stop trying to make himself relevant by announcing the cancellation of trips that should not have been put on the plan. “If President Ramaphosa cannot solve the energy crises, we do not see a reason why he must deliver the State of the Nation next month,” said Mdletshe.
