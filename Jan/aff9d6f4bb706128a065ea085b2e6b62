Durban - The family of 6-year-old Mayville child Anele Sphengane is looking for answers after she was found murdered in eNkanini in the area last week. Police said charges of murder and rape were being investigated. Anele’s aunt said she and the child’s mother last saw her on New Year’s Day and she was with a neighbour’s child. The aunt, Sibusisiwe Mnduna, said they initially thought Anele was still out playing with other children, but as time past and she did not return, they began searching for her. “It was on the 1st when we last saw Anele at about six o’clock in the evening and at about half-past seven we then started to search for her. At 9pm, we panicked and told everyone and asked if they had seen her and went to the police to open a case. “We searched until the morning, and then went to the police station to follow up. When we came back, someone told us that Anele had been found dead in a bush far from home,” said Mnduna. The aunt said Anele was an “angel” and losing her in this manner had broken their hearts. She said according to the police  there were signs of strangulation and her underwear was missing, which made them suspect that her niece could have been raped. “It was sad to see her lying there. I can't even speak, it is very hard for us as a family,” said Mnduna. Warren Burne, ward 30 councillor in Mayville, said he had been briefed by the community policing forum members about the incident. “It is a tragic incident. I can only imagine what the parents are going through. It is an awful thing, I would not wish this on anyone. I have not yet contacted the family but I did contact Cato Manor police and I will follow up again,” said Burne. KwaZulu-Natal SAPS spokesperson Colonel Nqobile Gwala said a case of murder and rape had been opened at the Cato Manor police station. “Cato Manor police are investigating charges after a body of a 6-year-old child was found,” said Gwala.
