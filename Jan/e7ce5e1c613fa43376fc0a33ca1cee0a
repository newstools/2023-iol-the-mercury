Durban: The Msunduzi Municipality has launched  a war on potholes and city officials spent last week fixing some of the potholes that have been a source of complaint by residents in the Northdale area. The municipality said it has a backlog of potholes that needed fixing and it is in the process of addressing this. It urged community members to send emails and notifications about the areas that have problems so they could be attended to. Last week, deputy mayor Mxolisi Mkhize led a team from the city Infrastructure Unit,  fixing potholes in ward 28. A by-election was held in the ward last week and it was won by the DA. Speaking via the municipality’s Facebook page, Mkhize said they had attended to the potholes in the ward following a string of complaints about the road conditions and planned to tackle similar problems in other roads. He said residents from different parts of the ward had sent emails complaining about the state of the roads in the area. He said residents, especially operators of scholar transport in that area, had complained about damage to tyres and car rims because of the condition of the road. “We will continue addressing this backlog that we have seen on the roads,” he said, urging residents to notify the municipality of the areas experiencing problems. He  said if they received alerts about other roads, they would deploy teams to address those problems. THE MERCURY
