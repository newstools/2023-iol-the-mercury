Durban - There has been mixed reaction to the plea from Prince Simakade Zulu for financial assistance for his legal bid to oust King Misuzulu as Zulu king. IOL reported on Tuesday that the call for donations was contained in a letter using the letterhead of the Prince Simakade KaZwelithini Foundation. Following reports on the call for donations, many people have taken to social media to question why he is seeking financial assistance, as the prince had made a public remark last year that he did not need anyone’s money. One social media user said: “As I recall, he indicated that he had had his own money, this is now the time to take from his reserves.” Others said they could not help the prince as they had their own financial challenges to face up to, including buying uniforms and stationery in preparation for the opening of schools.  “This month is tough on everyone. If the prince desires, I can direct him to a local loan shark,” read one comment. Another social media user suggested that the prince should assume public office in order to fend for himself.  “Please, can’t they just make him a councillor at Nongoma Municipality.” Some users were more crude, calling on the prince to guard his father’s livestock and “stop the madness”. In his court case, launched in the Gauteng High Court, Prince Simakade wants the court to review and set aside the decision made by President Cyril Ramaphosa to officially recognise King Misuzulu ka Zwelithini as the Zulu king.
