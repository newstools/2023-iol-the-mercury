Durban — The South African National Roads Agency SOC Limited (Sanral) has announced that blasting will be carried out on Wednesday, February 8 to remove rock outcrops on the N3 near the Camperdown Overpass Bridge. This forms part of the ongoing national road upgrades from Cato Ridge Interchange to Dardanelle - which is stretch of about 22.3 km on the national road. The blasting follows right on the steps of similar work that took place in July 2022 to remove rock outcrops and allow for the construction of a stormwater system and pavement layers. Rolling closures will be effected on the N3 in both directions between the Umlaas Road Interchange and the Cato Ridge Interchange, to minimise the delay of the traffic on the N3 during blasting, Sanrals eastern region project manager Mohamed Parak said. Temporary road closures in the vicinity of the Overpass Bridge will be erected on the R103, and the on-ramps at Cato Ridge Interchange and Camperdown Interchange will be temporarily closed during the blast,“ he said. “The road closures should not delay traffic for more than 10 minutes. “All closures shall immediately be removed as soon as the site of blasting has been declared safe.” Parak added that the speed limit along the route has been reduced to 80 km/hr to improve safety of the construction team and road users. “Lane closures to permit construction vehicles from safely entering and exiting the work zone, can be expected at night and the public will be informed in advance of such activity,” he said. Delays are expected as a result of the reduced speed limit, Parak said, urging motorists to plan their trips carefully and to be vigilant along the road during their travels. “We appeal to road users to note and comply with the advance warning signs and speed restrictions when travelling past the construction work zones and apologise for the inconvenience this may cause,” he said.
