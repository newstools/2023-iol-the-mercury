Durban - The SAPS says advertisements purporting to be from the police which call for interested persons to apply for police trainee programmes and other vacancies are fake. The SAPS said the bogus adverts referred members of the public to a website https://saps-trainership-form.blogspot.com which uses the SAPS logo. The fake website calls for people to enter their contact information including phone numbers to “apply” for the trainee positions.   The police said that legitimate adverts for trainees and vacancies were only published on its official website and in national newspapers. “As it is the norm, the SAPS wishes to state that advertisements for any posts within its structures are, if and when they become available, placed in a range of newspapers in the country to reach as many potential and suitable candidates as possible.  “The public should also bear in mind that they can view existing vacancies and obtain the application forms from the official website of the SAPS (www.saps.gov.za). Only information that is on this website can be regarded as authentic.” It added that there were currently no posts for police trainees and that these advertisements formed part of a scam aimed at misleading the public. “Members of the public are urged and advised to be vigilant and not to be misled by any false advertisements or advertising scams and to report these activities to the police.” THE MERCURY
