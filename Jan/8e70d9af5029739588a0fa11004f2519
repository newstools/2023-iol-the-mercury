Durban — While the Gateway Theatre of Shopping has confirmed that an incident took place at the Action Karting establishment at the centre which saw a 15-year-old left with serious spinal injuries, it has refused to be drawn on claims of negligence. Kristen Govender sustained spinal damage and being partially scalped after her hair got tangled during a go-kart ride at the Gateway Theatre last Wednesday. She sustained a spinal fracture, some spinal cord damage and a torn aorta which led to a haemorrhage. She is currently in hospital in ICU with no mobility from her waist down. Kristen’s father, Vernon Govender, claimed the incident was a result of “complete negligence” on the part of the go-karting place. The mall’s Michelle Shelley said: “Due to the sensitive nature of the incident and out of respect for the family we will not comment on the details of the incident at this stage.” She also refuted Govender’s statement published in the Daily News that since the incident he had received only one phone call from the go-karting establishment and that was to find out how his daughter was. “This statement is not correct. A representative from Centre Management has been in contact with the father since the day after the incident. Members of our team have also met with family members at the Centre Management office,” said Shelley. She also said it should be noted that after being made aware of the incident the centre’s control room proceeded to call emergency services. “The centre’s security supervisor was in attendance at the scene until the ambulance left the centre.” When asked whether there would be any sort of assistance, financial or otherwise, offered to the family from the mall, Shelley said, where possible, the centre would assist with any information, reports and details needed by the family.
