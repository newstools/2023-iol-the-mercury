Durban - Msunduzi Municipality city manager Lulamile Mapholoba paid a surprise visit to fleet departments including at Mayors Walk, Edendale and Forestry Depot to conduct an assessment of the working conditions on Wednesday.  Aside from inspecting tools of the trade at the sites that were visited, the city manager also interacted with staff members, getting an outline of their duties. Municipality spokesperson Ntobeko Mkhize said the city manager’s visit was important. “The municipality’s fleet department is one of the most important units because it is responsible for delivering services to communities. As a result, the municipality is able to generate much-needed revenue,” she said. The fire, rescue and refuse collection departments are some of the key units that are not able to perform their duties without vehicles.  The spokesperson added that Mapholoba had engaged with staff to discuss matters affecting their work. “Mapholoba noted all the challenges faced by the forestry, parks and recreation units, managers are expected to compile reports in order for solutions to be found,” she said.  The municipality has had challenges when it comes to delivering services to communities, including refuse collection.  It has often been criticised by locals and recently electricity department staff members who were attending to a power outage in one of the wards were attacked by the public. THE MERCURY
