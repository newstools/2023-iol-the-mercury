Durban - The KwaDukuza Municipality has dismissed suggestions that its mayor has interfered with the load shedding schedule to have it implemented selectively in some areas. It was alleged that load shedding is being used to punish some of the areas under the North Coast municipality for one reason or another. In a statement the municipality said it wanted to provide “clarity on the deceptive and unfounded narrative that has dominated social platforms over the implementation of load shedding in certain areas”. “We wish to dismiss the fallacy that the mayor Lindile Nhaca had interfered with Eskom to intentionally implement load shedding in certain parts of Ntshawini, Charlottedale, eThembeni and other areas. This is a wild and careless allegation that needs to be rightly clarified,” the municipality said. Municipal spokesperson Sipho Mkhize added that the motive behind the spreading of misinformation was not known. “The office (of the mayor) believes that there is a deliberate attempt to shift the blame to the mayor on how load shedding is implemented.” The municipality said load shedding is a national crisis that affects livelihoods and businesses across all municipalities. “It must be recorded that KwaDukuza Municipality implements load shedding under the command of Eskom and the mayor may not meddle in the affairs of Eskom or any entity in the implementation of load shedding. “We are of the view that the unfounded allegations against the mayor of KwaDukuza could only be generated by naysayers who are hellbent on creating mischief and instability in a bid to build mistrust between the leadership of KwaDukuza and the public,” it said.
