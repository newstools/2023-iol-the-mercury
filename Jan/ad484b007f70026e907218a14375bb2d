Durban - A hi-tech camera in Westville led an emergency services company to uncover suspected drug dealing activity which resulted in the arrest of a suspect by police on Monday. MOBI-CLAW911 said in a statement on its Facebook page that its control room operators were alerted to suspicious activity via a h-tech camera installed at Thekwini Toyota in Westville. “Filtering the footage through our artificial intelligence, the system alerted our operator to an individual of interest. “MOBI-CLAW911 control room personnel monitored the activity via the PTZ (Pan, Zoom and Tilt) camera and identified the activity as suspected drug dealing. They immediately reported the incident to SAPS.” MOBI-CLAW911 said the control room operator made contact with a responding officer on the ground, feeding him “up to the second” information on the suspect’s movements. “SAPS moved in quickly and effected the arrest, the suspected was found in possession of suspected narcotics. He has been detained pending further investigation. MOBI-CLAW911 has made the footage available to the investigating officer as evidence which may be used in court.” The company said the arrest demonstrated that investing in the right equipment and technology pays off.  “Thank you to Thekwini Toyota and other businesses within the Westville CBD for making this contribution to your community and creating a safe shopping environment.” Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Nqobile Gwala confirmed the arrest. “Westville police have arrested a 31-year-old man after he was found in possession of sixteen sloops of dagga at Buckingham Terrace in Westville. He was expected to appear in court on Monday.”       THE MERCURY
