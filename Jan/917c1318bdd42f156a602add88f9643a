Durban â€” The case against a high school teacher facing six counts of rape is expected to go to trial in late February. The 55-year-old man made his first appearance in the Pinetown Regional Court last Tuesday. Statements were handed to the defence to prepare for trial. The teacher, who had been working at Clermont High School since 2008, was arrested at the school in April last year. In May he was released on bail of R5 000, on condition that he relocates to his chosen alternative address in northern KwaZulu-Natal. The grey-haired man with a goatee sat comfortably outside the court chatting with two men who had accompanied him, waiting to be called. On the first count, he allegedly raped his 17-year-old victim on March 16, 2022. It is alleged that he raped her more than once. On the second count, he is alleged on that same day to have inserted his finger in her vagina. On count 3, on January 19 the accused allegedly raped another 17-year-old. The State alleges the victim was also raped more than once. Six days after this incident, the accused allegedly inserted his finger in the vagina of the same victim. The accused is also charged with indecent exposure to a child in 2021 when he allegedly pulled down his pants and exposed himself to 17-year-old victim at the school. On count six, the accused in February last year allegedly inserted his finger in the vagina of another 17-year-old victim, and also raped her more than once, according to the State. The accused is alleged to have repeated this act again in March on the same victim. He also faces a charge of sexual grooming of children in relation to another 17-year-old girl.
