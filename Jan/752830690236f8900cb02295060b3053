Durban — A new R27.5 million KwaDlangezwa Standard Library in northern KwaZulu-Natal is expected to be built by 2024. The library would not only assist in the education of the local children but it would also assist in passing on building and construction skills to the community. KwaDlangezwa is next to University of Zululand and is situated in ward 30 of the uMhlathuze Municipality. The library will offer the following upon its completion: • Internet connectivity with 10-15 computers for public use. • Library service, circulation of approximately 20 000 books, e-books (tertiary books, study materials, fiction and more). • Study space for approximately 200 people. • Toy library for the kids, with gaming. • Reading and literacy programmes. • Outreach programmes – for example library orientation, membership drive and more. Working together with amakhosi and councillors the construction is expected to provide jobs for hundreds of skilled and semi-skilled local personnel, said  KZN Sport, Arts and Culture MEC Amanda Bani-Mapena. She said the department was working with municipalities across the province to ensure that they bring much-needed facilities near to local communities to ease their burden. “Library infrastructure is but one example that ring-fences the future of our children. It enriches and nourishes knowledge base in our society. “We are very passionate about the unlimited potential of our children and libraries tap into their interests, aspirations and a drive to do better and improve their academic potential,” said Bani-Mapena. Local ward councillor Sgcino Mlambo said the people of KwaDlangezwa needed the facility because it promises long term beneficiation and security of some livelihoods.  “We do not envisage any work stoppages as a result of community unrest or raiding of the site,” Mlambo said.
