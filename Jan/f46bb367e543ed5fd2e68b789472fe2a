Durban – A large number of trucks brought traffic to a standstill on the N2 heading to Richards Bay Port on Monday.  Christo Botha, ward councillor in the Umhlathuze Municipality, said ahead of the festive season and on the request of the municipality, Transnet engaged with coal mines, transport companies and other stakeholders, in a bid to limit the volume of trucks destined for Richards Bay, over the festive season. “An agreement was reached from December 16, 2022 to January 5, 2023 which saw the volume of trucks dwindle significantly during this period.  “The city expected to see a sharp rise in volumes from Friday, January 6 and from yesterday the volumes of trucks destined for the Port of Richards Bay increased.” In a video shared on his Facebook page, queues of trucks are seen on the N2 on Sunday.  Botha added that by 2.30pm on Monday the queue on the N2 from the John Ross intersection towards Nseleni/Richards Bay stretched 11.5km.  “Visible law enforcement are all around.  “Traffic officers release the number of trucks as per specific request from Transnet depending on the volumes processed at the port.” A motorist who videoed  the trucks at a standstill on the N2 heading towards Richards Bay port said that there were several kilometres of trucks.  “If you are travelling on the N2 south heading towards Richards Bay please be extremely cautious.  “If you are on the north bound, also be extremely cautious as vehicles are trying to overtake and heading onto the oncoming lane.” The uMhlathuze Municipality and Transnet have been approached for comment.
