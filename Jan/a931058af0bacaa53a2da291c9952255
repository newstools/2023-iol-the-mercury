Durban - Political rivals the ANC and the DA in Pietermaritzburg are both confident of winning the ward 28 by-election in Northdale under Msunduzi Municipality next week.  The ward has been a hive of activity in recent weeks and days as parties continue with campaigning in the hope of gaining control of the ward which has exchanged hands within the two parties in the past terms. The by-election is set to take place on January 18. ANC Moses Mabhida regional secretary Samora Ndlovu said they were hopeful of snatching the ward, which was under the DA, decrying poor service delivery in the area. “We have observed how service delivery has ground to a halt  in the ward, with overgrown vegetation and street lights that do not work. Our hope is that our message will be heard and residents will give the ANC a chance” said Ndlovu. He indicated that campaigning would continue until the day of the poll next week. The ANC will field Parusha Chetty and the DA will have Renisha Singh as their candidates. Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) spokesperson Thabani Ngwira confirmed that the by-election was going ahead following the resignation of DA councillor Lucky Naicker. “There are currently 9 539 registered voters in Msunduzi ward 28. We encourage all registered voters in ward 28 to come out in their numbers to cast their votes on voting day,”  said the spokesperson. He added that voting stations would open at 7am and close at 9pm, stressing that voters should bring their green bar-coded ID or their Temporary ID Certificate. “To the contesting parties, we encourage political tolerance and to abide by the Commission’s Code of Conduct,”  the spokesperson said.
