Durban - The IFP in KwaZulu-Natal says flood victims are still living in a community hall in KwaDukuza, north of Durban. IFP MPL, KwaDukuza Constituency Ncamisile Nkwanyana said the IFP KwaDukuza local leadership had planned to have a meeting at Lindelani Community Hall on Sunday but were shocked to find 10 families affected by the 2022 floods still living in the hall.  She said they were then forced to hold their meeting outside the hall.  She added that the conditions in the hall are not suitable for human habitation  and said the families said they have been surviving on donations from good Samaritans, including local church pastors. “There is a vacuum at the heart of the ANC government. KZN Premier, Nomusa Dube-Ncube, announced last year that all flood victims would be moved from temporary shelters and relocated by Christmas Day. This is blatantly untrue, as we still have flood victims in Lindelani Hall in KwaDukuza almost a month later. There are unoccupied houses in KwaDukuza, yet the flood victims have not been moved to those houses,” said Nkwanyana.   She added that the government lacked empathy and “any semblance of compassion”, saying the party would demand answers from Dube-Ncube and KZN MEC for Human Settlements Ntuthuko Mahlaba. KwaDukuza Municipality spokesperson Sipho Mkhize said as far as he was aware the Lindelani Community Hall was no longer being used to house flood victims.  He said he would contact the Human Settlement and Disaster Management team to confirm if flood victims were living there. THE MERCURY
