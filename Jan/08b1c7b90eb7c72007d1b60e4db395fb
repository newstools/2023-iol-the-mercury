Durban - South African men need to play a greater role in the campaign against gender-based violence (GBV), the Nazareth Baptist Church in eBuhleni said yesterday. As the church members embark on a seven-day pilgrimage to the holy mountain of Nhlangakazi, Shembe church spokesperson Thokozani Mncwabe expressed concern over the number of incidents of abuse of women and children, calling on men to lead the fight against the scourge. “Part of what we will be praying for is an end to this problem of abuse, especially the rape of women we are seeing in the country,” said Mncwabe. The spokesperson emphasised the role that should be played by men to protect women. “Women are the greatest gifts and should be provided with all the protection and that is the gospel we are preaching, for men to protect the country’s women,” he said. As thousands of members make the journey, Mncwabe expressed confidence that the pilgrimage and the festivities attached to it would go well, pointing to the preparations made in anticipation of a large turnout. “We planned for the event in December and went through everything that is required, so we are quite convinced that everything will be fine,” Mncwabe said. The pilgrimage is regarded as one of the most important gatherings on the province’s calendar, and is often attended by leading figures from many walks of life as a symbol of the respect accorded to the church, which has one of the largest followings in South Africa. Today eThekwini Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda will hold a joint media briefing with the mayor of the Ilembe District Municipality, Thobani Shandu, and Ndwedwe Local Municipality Mayor Sam Mfeka on the municipalities’ state of readiness to support thousands of Nazareth Baptist Church devotees as they embark on the pilgrimage.
