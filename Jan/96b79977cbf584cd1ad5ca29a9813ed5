Durban - A 24-year-old man, who sustained stab wounds, told private emergency and security services officers that he was attacked in his home in the early hours of Sunday morning, New Year’s Day in Canelands near Verulam, north of Durban. Reaction Unit SA (Rusa) spokesperson Prem Balram said the victim had stab wounds to his shoulder and chest.  “Members of Rusa were dispatched to a residence on Sunday evening at 6:17pm after receiving a call for assistance. On arrival, Reaction Officers located a man in his bedroom. He had sustained stab wounds to his right shoulder and chest.” Balram added that according to the victim, four suspects forced their way into his residence around 3.30am that morning.  “The robbers stabbed him but fled empty handed.” He added that the man said he had contacted Emergency Services but received no assistance.  “His friends heard of the incident this afternoon and discovered the injured man in his bed. They then contacted Rusa for assistance.” In a separate incident on Christmas Day, Rusa responded to a house break-in at Brindhaven in Verulam. Balram said that two TVs were among the stolen items.  “A house in Brindhaven was broken into. Members of Rusa were called out to the property at 11:06am on Sunday. On arrival, the Reaction Officers discovered that forced entry was gained via the kitchen door. The entire house was ransacked. The time of the burglary could not be confirmed.” Police have been approached for comment regarding the incidents. THE MERCURY
