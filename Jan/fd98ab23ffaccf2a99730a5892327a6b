Durban - Five suspects who allegedly committed a house robbery in the Malvern area of Durban on Tuesday and crashed into a truck on the M7 in the vicinity of Southway Mall while evading police, have been arrested and are under police guard at a hospital. Provincial police spokesperson Colonel Robert Netshiunda said on Wednesday that the five suspects are recovering in hospital under police guard after their attempts to evade arrest resulted in an accident on Tuesday afternoon. Detailing the events that led to the crash, Netshiunda said the SAPS Umbilo Task Team were patrolling along Fielden Drive in Umbilo when they spotted a vehicle with six occupants. “The vehicle was positively identified as one which was reported to have been involved in a house robbery in the Malvern area earlier in the day,” he said. He said after the suspects defied the instruction from police to stop, a high speed chase ensued. Netshiunda said the suspects allegedly drove into oncoming traffic and collided head-on with a horse and trailer.   “The driver of the suspects’ vehicle succumbed to his injuries at the scene and the other five suspects were arrested and taken to hospital for treatment,” he said. Police said the suspects were allegedly found in possession of three firearms and 19 rounds of ammunition. “Two of the firearms were positively linked with house robbery cases in Malvern and Pinetown which they allegedly committed in December.” Netshiunda said the five suspects, aged between 20 and 27, will appear in court soon.
