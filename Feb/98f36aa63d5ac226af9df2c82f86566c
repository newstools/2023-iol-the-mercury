The learner handbook in every school is prepared to serve as a guide to school activities, policies and sanctions given for violating school policies. Parents and learners must take the time to go through the handbook, as school policies and procedures are outlined and explained. The handbook is in place to make the school safe and for learners and parents to have a successful school experience. Learners should strive to live in harmony with all the rules of the school and universal human values. A holistic academic environment among all stakeholders within the school is needed for quality teaching and effective learning to take place. The proverb “it takes a village to raise a child” is still spot on. Regrettably, many principals and teachers face challenges in implementing school policies. Absenteeism, late-coming, bullying, school vandalism and other disciplinary problems affect the smooth running of the school. Parents are the first mentors of their children. There is a famous saying in my vernacular language: “the mother’s lap is the first learning point for the child”. The home and social environment are fundamental parts of a child’s development. Support given to learners at home and participating in school events will improve learning outcomes. According to the grade and age of the child, assistance and supervision with homework and other school related matters must be provided for from the home. * Mohamed Saeed, Pietermaritzburg.  ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
