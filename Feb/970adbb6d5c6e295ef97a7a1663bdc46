Durban – Chaplain Mthokozisi Luvuno has called on ANC’s members to guard against any action that may bring the party’s name into disrepute, especially on social media.  Speaking during the KwaZulu-Natal ANC’s 111th birthday rally in Hammarsdale on Sunday, Luvuno expressed concern about recent images and messages that had been posted on social media by some ANC members, calling for this to end.  The event was attended by the ruling party top brass that included secretary-general Fikile Mbalula, ANC KZN chairperson Siboniso Duma and national executive committee members Bheki Cele and Dr Zweli Mkhize. “We have noted that when some comrades are drinking alcohol they post these images when they are wearing ANC regalia or bearing the party brand and we do not encourage such action because the ANC name is held in high regard,” the chaplain told party members. He added that some of the messages were divisive and had the potential of causing harm in the ruling party structures.  The chaplain also urged party members and community members attending Sunday’s celebrations to continue participating in governance activities.  Sunday’s event turned the township into a hive activity, enabling street vendors to sell their items to the visitors who came from different parts of the province including the KZN Midlands and the South Coast. The ANC expressed with the turnout at the stadium. THE MERCURY
