Durban - KwaZulu-Natal Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza has given an assurance that outstanding payments to non-profit organisations (NPOs) would be made by tomorrow (Wednesday). She said there had been some glitches which had affected the payment process. “We had faced some technical glitches with regard to the payment of some NPOs, but we resolved the problem, with some receiving their payments last week. The department remains dedicated to providing quality social services to its communities, working with over 600 NPOs and other stakeholders across the province,” Khoza said. She was speaking during the department’s briefing to the portfolio committee on social development. Khoza said it had not been easy to render services to the public and Covid-19 was one of the things that made it difficult. “Despite being hindered by limited resources, both financial and human, the department is making progress and advertising a number of posts with the view to maximising the capacity to deliver services. The Covid-19 pandemic has only exacerbated the demand for services, which is stretching the department’s resources and employees,” she said. The MEC also revealed to the committee that they have employed 30 gender-based violence (GBV) social workers in addition to 153 social workers who are stationed in police stations across the province. KZN social development portfolio chairperson Nonzwakazi Swaartbooi-Ntombela applauded the department for its commitment to serving the people. THE MERCURY
