Durban - The National Freedom Party (NFP) has paid tribute to its founder and late president Zanele KaMagwaza-Msibi as they marked her birthday on Wednesday. In a media briefing in Durban, the NFP leadership described KaMagwaza-Msibi as an individual who was committed to serving the people.  “We remember our president as an individual who was passionate about the development of communities and did not seek to enrich herself,” said the NFP’s Canaan Mdletshe. He said under KaMagwaza-Msibi’s leadership, Zululand District Municipality was renowned for its service delivery, especially in the area of water provision, decrying how the standards had declined in recent times.  The NFP leadership said they wanted to see councillors who are committed to serving people, and not to enrich themselves in line with the principles of the founding leader. The party said it was concerned that local government is becoming a haven for gun-toting individuals who are masquerading as councillors.  The party said these individuals did not have the interest of local residents, but simply want to line their pockets. Mdletshe also indicated that they wanted to meet the police top brass, including possibly Minister Bheki Cele to discuss the safety of their members in public office as councillors.  “This is a matter that we take very seriously and are concerned about the safety of our colleagues and would like to see the police acting on it,” Mdletshe said. He stressed that any member of the party who demonstrated selfishness would not be retained in the party ranks as this would amount to the betrayal of the party’s founding principles, that had been established by KaMagwaza-Msibi.
