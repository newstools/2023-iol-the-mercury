Durban – A man and his five-year-old daughter were transported to a hospital after the tipper truck they were travelling in overturned in Mt Moreland near Verulam in KwaZulu-Natal on Friday. According to Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson Prem Balram, a 37-year-old man and his five-year old daughter sustained injuries after the truck overturned on an unpaved road. “On arrival, Reaction Officers discovered the truck lying on its side. The driver was located on the road carrying his minor daughter. “He explained that one of the front tyres suddenly locked which caused the fully loaded truck to overturn,” said Balram. Balram said both the father and his daughter were treated for their injuries on scene before being transported to hospital by ambulance.   In an accident on Saturday, IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson Dylan Meyrick said paramedics responded to reports of a motor vehicle collision on the N2 at the Mvoti Toll Gate. “On arrival of paramedics it was discovered that a light motor vehicle had crashed into a concrete barrier at the toll gate. According to the driver, the vehicle had experienced a mechanical failure resulting in him veering to the side to avoid rear-ending a truck,” he said. Meyrick said four patients sustained injuries ranging from moderate to minor and were transported to nearby facilities for further care by IPSS Medical Rescue.   THE MERCURY
