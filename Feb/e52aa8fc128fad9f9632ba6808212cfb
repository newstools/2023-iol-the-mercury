Durban - Former EFF KwaZulu-Natal leader Vusi Khoza says he is looking forward to being present for the State of the Nation address on Thursday, and is not scared of what may happen to him, as he will follow the mandate of his party regarding the event. Khoza was sworn in as one of the new MPs this week and will be among those to listen to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s address. However the EFF has made it clear that it would not make it easy for Ramaphosa to deliver his speech. EFF leader Julius Malema promised that the party’s members will not allow the president to address the nation unless he answers questions about the Phala Phala matter  “On the February 9, we are going to show him what we are made of when we are there. We will never be addressed by a constitutional delinquent,” Malema said of Ramaphosa to party members at a gathering last weekend. Khoza said he was ready for a possible clash with security personnel.  “I am really looking forward to the event this evening, and to be honest I am really excited about it,” said Khoza. “The fact of the matter is we were threatened by the apartheid government with security forces but that did not deter us from fighting for freedom. The same principle applies here, we want accountability and we will not allow the threat of security to stand in our way from this demand,”  Khoza said. The EFF MP added that he was “getting used” to life in Cape Town. THE MERCURY
