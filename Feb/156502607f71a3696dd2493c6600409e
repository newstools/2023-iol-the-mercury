Durban — The next step for the Durban teen, who was still in ICU after sustaining serious injuries while go-karting at an establishment at the Gateway Theatre of Shopping, was going to a rehabilitation facility. Kristen Govender, 15, sustained spinal damage and was partially scalped after her hair became entangled during a go-kart ride in December. On Tuesday, her father, Vernon Govender, said the family were notified by doctors that they were pleased with Kristen’s recovery and progress thus far. “The doctors will not be doing any surgery. The next step for her now would be going to a rehabilitation facility because there’s not much more that they can do for her.  Doctors said if they keep her much longer in hospital, things like her muscle tone was going to be worse.” Govender said his daughter was still processing the trauma of the ordeal, coupled with having missed the beginning of the school term. “However, the school that she goes to has been very supportive, keeping her abreast of what is going on, sending her set books and work so that she can catch up while in the hospital. She is also seeing a counsellor, and that is helping her to manage,” Govender said.  He said that Kristen had already started on some of the school work that had been sent to her. Kristen has started with her English set book, reading, and summarising, something that was helping with keeping her mind off her injuries.  When asked whether the family would be taking any legal recourse against the establishment and or the Gateway Shopping Mall, Govender said the family had appointed an attorney to take care of that aspect.  “I do not know what stage the process is at, but we have appointed an attorney, and he is working on that doing the necessary investigations.” WhatsApp your views on this story at 071 485 7995 Daily News
