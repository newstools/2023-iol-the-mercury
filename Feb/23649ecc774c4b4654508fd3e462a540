He dismissed suggestions that the visit was part of a strategy to draw support from the church which has one of the largest followers in South Africa, in the run-up to the elections next year. “This visit to church leaders began when my predecessor Zwakele Mncwango (now leader of ActionSA in KZN), led the DA and it is tradition that we are going to continue with because of the important role that church leaders play in our society,” Rodgers continued. He decried the challenges facing KwaZulu-Natal and the rest of the country, especially crime and gender-based violence ravaging communities and how authorities appeared to be failing. “This is where church leaders can help so that problems facing communities can be addressed and sometimes we do not appreciate the role that these institutions play in our lives and this was part of the visit,” Rodgers explained.  He stressed that the party leadership would continue to visit other churches across the province throughout the year.
