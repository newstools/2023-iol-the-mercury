Durban - Visits to local schools in Pietermaritzburg yesterday by Msunduzi Municipality officials including deputy mayor Mxolisi Mkhize led to the discovery that community members were using public institutions to get illegal access to services. The deputy mayor who heads the Infrastructure portfolio committee, said they visited three schools and discovered that communities were abusing public facilities.  He was accompanied by Ward 14 councillor Sibusiso Mkhize and Msunduzi officials. At one of the reservoirs, it was discovered that an illegal connection had been made. “The connection has been restricted and the reservoir is being filled which will assist in supplying water to the community and schools affected. An investigation will be conducted to trace the source of the connection.” Municipality spokesperson Ntobeko Mkhize expressed the municipality’s concern about the illegal connections, warning that illegally tapping into reservoir lines that supply schools had a direct impact on the supply of water into the school and neighbouring community. “Community members are urged to not make illegal connections as this impacts the greater community when it comes to the supply of water,” said Mkhize.
