Durban — The eThekwini Municipality has given a stern warning to contractors and property owners who are damaging underground power cables. In a brief statement, the municipality said that it is concerned by an increasing number of power outages recently. It said that the outages are caused by contractors and property owners who when excavating disregard signs of underground cables. This usually plunges thousands of residents into darkness.

"The city hereby urges consumers, contractors and property owners who wish to excavate to follow the proper procedure. They should do this by visiting the municipal offices to get a GIS record of the location of the infrastructure that is beneath the ground. "Those found to have damaged electrical cables will be fined and be charged the full cost of electrical repairs," the municipality continued. It added that damage to underground cables not only leaves residents in darkness, but can cause fatal or severe injury by electric shock and explosion.
