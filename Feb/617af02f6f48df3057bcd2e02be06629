Durban — The Department of Employment and Labour has said any injury or disease contracted in the line of duty should be reported to the Compensation Fund.  The department revealed this during a training scheduled for organised labour in North West by the Compensation Fund which focuses on compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act and Occupational Health and Safety Act compliance in the workplace. Paul Nyathela, assistant director for compensation benefits, indicated that it was important for the employer to report any of the injuries contracted on duty, irrespective of their nature or urgency, as complications may resurface at a later stage. He added that if the employer does not report cases, an employee is also allowed to report. “An injury may appear as not serious at the time it took place but can resurface at a later stage, and with the request of the treating doctor it can be reopened. Always urge your colleagues and employers to ensure that all cases are reported, whether big or small,” said Nyathela. Benefits covered by the fund include temporary total/partial disablement, compensation for permanent disablement, constant care allowance, fatal benefits payable to dependants of deceased employees and commutation of pensions. Nyathela further said the Compensation Fund provides compensation to employees who are injured or contract diseases while on duty.  The department said that the Compensation Fund provides compensation to employees who are injured or contract diseases while on duty. The Compensation Fund is governed by the Compensation for Occupation Injuries and Diseases Act (COIDA) of 1993 (amended in 1997) which determines how, and by whom the fund is administered and the conditions for eligibility for compensation.
